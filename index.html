<h2>About FoLiA</h2>

<p><strong>FoLiA</strong> is an XML-based annotation format, suitable for the
representation of linguistically annotated language resources. FoLiA’s intended
use is as a format for storing and/or exchanging language resources, including
corpora. Our aim is to introduce a single rich format that can accomodate a
wide variety of linguistic annotation types through a single generalised
paradigm. We do not commit to any label set, language or linguistic theory.
This is always left to the developer of the language resource, and provides
maximum flexibility.</p>

<p>XML is an inherently hierarchic format. <strong>FoLiA</strong> does justice
to this by maximally utilising a hierarchic, inline, setup.</p>


<p>Our aim with <strong>FoLiA</strong> is not to introduce yet another
format, but to build a rich and practical infrastructure around this format.
This includes tools, programming libraries, converters, visualisations and
annotation environments.

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Generalised paradigm</strong> - We use a generalised paradigm, with
as few ad-hoc provisions for annotation types as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Expressivity</strong> - The format is highly expressive,
annotations can be expressed in great detail and with flexibility to the user’s
needs, without forcing unwanted details. Moreover, FoLiA has generalised
support for representing annotation alternatives, and annotation metadata such
as information on annotator, time of annotation, and annotation
confidence.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible</strong> - Due to the generalised paradigm and the fact
that the format does not commit to any label set, FoLiA is fairly easily
extensible.</li> <li><strong>Formalised</strong> - The format is formalised,
and can be validated on both a shallow and a deep level (the latter including
tagset validation), and easily machine parsable, for which tools are
provided.</li>
<li><strong>Practical</strong> - FoLiA has been developed in a bottom-up
fashion right alongside applications, libraries, and other toolkits and
converters. Whilst the format is rich, we try to maintain it as simple and
straightforward as possible, minimising the learning curve and making it easy
to adopt FoLiA in practical applications.</li> </ul>

<p>
The FoLiA format makes mixed-use of inline and stand-off annotation. Inline
annotation is used for annotations pertaining to single tokens, whilst
stand-off annotation in a separate annotation layers is adopted for annotation
types that span over multiple tokens. This provides FoLiA with the necessary
flexibility and extensibility to deal with various kinds of annotations.</p>

<p>Two software libraries are available for working with the FoLiA format from
within your own scripts and applications. Make sure to check back regularly for
updates, as both are still being actively developed.</p>

<p>FoLiA is currently used in a wide variety of projects in the Dutch and Flemish Natural Language Processing community. The largest Dutch corpus, SoNaR, is delivered in FoLiA format, and various <a href="http://www.clarin.nl">CLARIN projects</a> make use of it as well. Support for FoLiA is integrated into various software projects; including <a href="http://ilk.uvt.nl/ucto">ucto</a>, <a href="http://ilk.uvt.nl/frog">Frog</a>, <a href="http://valkuil.net">Valkuil.net</a>.</p>

<p>FoLiA was developed by Maarten van Gompel at Tilburg University and now at Radboud University Nijmegen, with input from Antal van den Bosch, Ko van der Sloot, Martin Reynaert and many other people in the academic community. </p>
